This device tree turns the ZTE V55 (Optik) into a WiFi only tablet and contains improvements over the original. Please note that it may also be wildly broken because I'm not that great of a dev.

Most of the credit for this goes to joestone, who originally wrote the tree and continues to assist me in its development.

Kernel Source is newkernel.zip under kernel/zte/ folder. Credit goes to all kernel devs.
